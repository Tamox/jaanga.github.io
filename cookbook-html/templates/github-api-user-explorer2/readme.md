_GitHub API User Explorer_

***



## Concept

GitHub has millions of project. Finding projects that interest you is not easy. Finding projects with code you can use is not easy.

And then when you are notified about a GitHub user of interest, it's not that easy to explore their work.

There may be many repositories. There may be a lot of material that looks interesting but has not been updated in years

Then there is the other side of the coin:

How can you make your work more visible to the world?

How can visitors to you GitHb projects become informed in a speedy, fun manner about all the things you are doing.

Certainly the GitHub Explore is a good place to start. And there are a number of really interesting curation efforts.

And none of that stops you or us from investigating even more ways of explring GitHub

And, of course, GitHuB supplies a quite amazing tool for finding stuff on GitHub

The GitHub developers API provides fast, free and easy access to millions of GitHub projects.
