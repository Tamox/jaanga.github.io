_Infinite Landscape_


## Concept

Using buttons, cursor keys, mouse or a 3D input device, to be able to traverse landscape composed of a grid of tiles 
where each tile represents a unique location with the conditions that
only a small array of rows and columns of tiles adjacent to the camera target is visible at any time 
thus keeping the number of items to be rendered to a reasonable limits - such as no more than a million vertices at any given moment.

* Edit this code


## Issues

* Too many to catalog

## Users

Intended for Leap Motion device, FGx and terrain projects


## Change Log

### 2016-09-30 ~ Within Distance R1

The center of attention can be at any place at any time
The code must be able to deal with previously used elements where ever they may be


* Easy and seems to solve the problem
* Tidies based on the idea that elements further than a given distanve from the center of attention may be removed

### 2016-06-06 ~ R4

* Improvements to the movements
* Add random placement within a 1000x1000 grid of points 
* Add readme
